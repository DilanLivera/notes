## Performance testing

The following is from the [JMeter - Getting Started by Esteban Herrera](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/jmeter-getting-started) course.

### Performance testing metrics

- Response time
- Throughput
- Reliability
- Scalability

ðŸ’¡ _Identify the performance requirements of your application before you start performance testing your application. Don't forget to begin performance testing your application early in the development process._

### Performance testing process

1. Design and build tests
2. Prepare the test environment
3. Run the tests
4. Analyze the results
5. Optimize
6. Retest

### Performance test types

- Smoke tests
- Load tests
- Stress tests
- Spike tests
- Endurance tests

ðŸ’¡ _JMeter is not a browser. It doesn't render HTML responses and execute JavaScript code. JMeter works at the protocol level simulating network requests._
