There are two types of health checks.

1. Liveness health check - Only report if the application is running.
2. Readiness health check - Allows you to check the health of any additional functionality that your application needs in order to function.

### Health Status

- Healthy
- Degraded
- Unhealthy

ðŸ’¡ *ASP.Net Core Health Checks allow you to feature multiple health check endpoints within your application and each one can execute different sets of health checks. For each health check endpoint, you can have a custom health check response.*
