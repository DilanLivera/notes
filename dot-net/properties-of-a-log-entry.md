### Whatâ€™s Missing?

- Machine name
- Environment
- User Id
- Role(s)
- Entry Assembly
- Version
- Customer Id
- HttpContext
- Include whatâ€™s important to YOU

ðŸ’¡ _Include what is important to you in the log entry(Think about what will assist you in troubleshooting/analyze an issue). Don't log what you don't need. It can be expensive._
